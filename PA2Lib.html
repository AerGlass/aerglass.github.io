PA2lib is a library for libnds, written on c. It is based on nightfox's lib for libnds.<br>
  It is so simple to learn yet so powerful. <br>
  PA2lib also comes with SimplePA2lib (spa) which simplifies the usage even more. <br>
  This is the only library which is still maintaned, nightfox's lib isn't maintained anymore.<br>
