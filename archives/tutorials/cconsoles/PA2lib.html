  <body>
This guide will teach you how to use PA2lib + Simple PA2Lib</p>
Features of PA2lib:<br>
Very small (less than a mb)<br>
Very easy and powewrful <br>
works with latest libnds/devkitarm<br>
Installation is easy for begginers. </p>
Cons:<br>
If you want to migrate from palib/nightfox's lib for libnds, then installation is somewhat complex. <br>
There has been multiple/undefinied definition/references while using PA2lib.<br>
This on beta, so it isn't tested well.</p>
<h1> why does pa2lib exist</h1></p>
learning libnds is somewhat complex.</p>
<h1>What is Simple PA2Lib? </h1></p>
is a wrapper that simplifies the usage of PA2lib, however, this is not needed, and you can use PA2Lib on your own.<br>
I recommend PA2Lib + Simple PA2Lib since its easier.</p>
