  <tr><td> Welcome to cubed studios, this group of people makes things like animations and <br> games, actually there is only one person on the team, thecathacker562<br>
thanks to him because he wrote all of this website.<br> 
here is nothing, nothing, there isn't. <br> 
    I will fill this page with something ;) <br></p>
  <h1> why does this exist? </h1> </p>
  someone invited me to a thing (anyverty) we made a lot of comics, which you can't find on the internet, <br>
one day of 2020 he said "i am gonna sell this to other people"
  and because of that, i wasn't there anymore. <br>
After talking alot with him, he already sold the entire thing, sad. 
<br>after alot of thinking i came up with the idea of cubed studios, home of comics and interesting software </p>
<h4><strong>Cubed Studios was made in 2020 but the website was made in 2021 (NO COPYRIGHTED.)</h4></strong> </p>
<h1> What does this team does? </h1> </p>
